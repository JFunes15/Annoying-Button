It is invincible until it exposes its tentacles, and it will only do this if there is only one party member alive; if there is more than one party member alive and its tentacles are not exposed, Ruby will remove characters from battle until only one party member remains.

Later, it is fought as a boss battle,[note 1] first in a mandatory Mideel battle during 'Struggle for the Huge Materia', and later can be encountered in optional battles. The player can find it roaming the skies and ram it with their airship and chase it when it settles on a location where it can be fought.

    words.innerText ="Ultimate weapons are distinguishable for having unique damage algorithms, as well as eight linked Materia slots with zero Materia growth. Because of the weapons' unique damage algorithms, the damage they deal can be lower than that of other weapons under certain circumstances, making them not always the ideal weapon to equip. Unlike most other damage modifiers, each character's ultimate weapon applies the damage modifier after all other modifiers, instead of modifying the attack strength of the weapon itself. Cloud's ultimate weapon is the Ultima Weapon, dropped by the Ultimate Weapon boss. It deals more damage based on how close Cloud is to full HP. This 'raw damage' is then modified by the attack's strength (1 if it is a normal attack) and other modifiers. At full HP, the weapon would deal 4x damage and 1x damage at about 1/3rd HP. Barret's ultimate weapon, the Missing Score, is found inside the Sister Ray just before battling Helletic Hojo, but Barret must be in the party to receive it. It deals more damage the more AP the Materia loaded onto it contain. Because of its unique damage algorithm, Missing Score is subject to the overflow glitch that can let Barret kill any opponent in one hit. Master Magic, Master Command, Master Summon, Enemy Skill, and Underwater Materia do not add to this formula. Tifa's ultimate weapon is the Premium Heart obtained by examining a machine in the abandoned building that has a sign ITEM outside in Wall Market. It can be obtained after the player has found the Key to Midgar buried in Bone Village, which becomes available when Cloud and Tifa rejoin the party. The maximum Limit Bar Units is 255 regardless of Limit level (the Limit level simply adjusts the rate at which the bar fills). When the bar is full, the weapon does roughly 1â€“4x of its normal damage depending on the Limit level, and would do 1/16 of that damage when the Limit bar is empty. Unlike most weapon damage modifiers, this modifier does not solely adjust the weapon's attack power, but the character's final attack power, which includes Tifa's Strength and weapon attack bonus. Aeris's ultimate weapon, Princess Guard, can be found in room four of the clock room in the Temple of the Ancients. It is the only ultimate weapon that has Materia growth and has fewer than eight linked Materia slots. It deals more damage if her allies are KO'd.";
